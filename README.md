<summary><strong>🗺️ Peek Under the Hood: Our Production-Grade Architecture</strong></summary>

Ideagen is built on a robust, decoupled architecture, ensuring security, scalability, and a seamless creative workflow.

-   🧠 **The AI Core (Backend)**: At the heart of Ideagen is our powerful, cloud-native backend. It acts as a secure and intelligent command center for all AI operations, intelligently routing your requests to the best models (like Gemini or Cerebras) for the job. All API communication is handled securely on the server, keeping your data and credentials safe.

-   🎨 **The Creative Studio (Frontend)**: Your interface to this power is a sleek, responsive studio built with React. It's an intuitive workspace where you can visually construct your narrative, configure every detail, and see real-time previews as the AI Core finishes rendering each clip.

-   ✂️ **The Private Post-Production Suite (Browser-Side Merging)**: The final, most critical step—the final cut—happens directly in your browser. Using the power of **FFmpeg.wasm**, all your generated clips are stitched together on your local machine. This is the ultimate in privacy and speed, with zero server costs for merging.
