<summary><strong>💻 Running Locally: Step-by-Step Guide</strong></summary>

To run this project on your own machine, you'll need to set up your API key in an environment file.

1.  **Get a Google AI Studio API Key:**
    *   Navigate to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    *   Click on **"Get API key"** and create a new key.
    *   **Important:** Video generation is a billable feature. You may need to enable billing on your Google Cloud project. You can find more info here: [Google AI Billing Information](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing).

2.  **Create a `.env` File:**
    *   In the root directory of this project, create a new file named `.env`.

3.  **Add Your API Key to the `.env` File:**
    *   Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with the key you just created:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Serve the Application:**
    *   This project is a pure client-side application and doesn't require a build step. You just need to serve the `index.html` file from a local web server.
    *   If you have Python installed, you can easily start a server by running this command in your terminal from the project's root directory:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can use a tool like the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

5.  **Open in Browser:**
    *   Once your server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the local address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`). The application should now load and detect your API key.

<summary><strong>🚀 Core Features Explained in Detail</strong></summary>

### 📝 **Intuitive Storyboard UI**
The entire creative process is managed in a clean, organized storyboard, making complex video creation feel simple.
-   **Dynamic Clip Management:** Easily add, remove, and configure multiple clips. Each clip is a self-contained scene in your movie.
-   **Focus Mode:** Expand or collapse each clip's form to focus on what you're editing without clutter. This is especially useful for large projects.
-   **Live Previews:** As each clip is generated, a video preview appears directly in its card. Watch your movie come together scene by scene!
-   **Smart Buttons:** Action buttons like "Generate" and "Merge" are intelligently enabled or disabled based on the state of your storyboard, guiding you through the creation process.

### 🎬 **Pre-loaded Feature Film Script: "Stardust Gambit"**
-   Jumpstart your creativity with the entire script for a short sci-fi film pre-loaded as a multi-clip storyboard. It's the perfect way to explore Ideagen's full capabilities right out of the box without having to write a single prompt. Just click "Generate"!

### 🤖 **AI Video Generation (via Gemini API)**
Leverage Google's state-of-the-art video models.
-   **Text-to-Video:** Write a descriptive prompt and watch the AI bring it to life. The only limit is your imagination!

### Component Breakdown:
*   **`App.tsx`**: The heart of the application. It acts as the central controller, managing the overall state (like the list of clips, API key status, and current app status: 'editing', 'generating', 'merging', 'done') and orchestrating the interactions between all other components and services.
*   **`geminiService.ts`**: This is the dedicated API layer. It contains all the logic for communicating with the Google Gemini APIs for video and speech generation. It also houses utility functions like file-to-base64 conversion and creating WAV file headers for the raw audio data.
*   **`ffmpegService.ts`**: The client-side video powerhouse. This service dynamically loads the `ffmpeg.wasm` library on demand and contains the complex logic for stitching video and audio clips together into the final output file, right in the user's browser.
*   **`/components`**: This directory contains all the modular React components that make up the UI, such as the `Storyboard` (which lists all clips), the `ClipForm` (the editor for a single clip), the `LoadingIndicator`, and the final `VideoPlayer`. This separation keeps the UI logic clean and maintainable.

<summary><strong>💻 Tech Stack & Philosophy</strong></summary>

-   **⚛️ Frontend Framework:** [React](https://reactjs.org/)
    -   *Why?* For its component-based architecture, which is perfect for building a modular and maintainable UI like our storyboard. State management with hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) allows for predictable and reactive updates.

-   **⌨️ Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
    -   *Why?* To provide strong typing for our data structures (like `Clip` and `VideoConfig`), which catches errors early, improves developer experience with autocompletion, and makes the code more robust and easier to refactor.

-   **🤖 AI Models:** [Google Gemini API (Veo & TTS)](https://ai.google.dev/)
    -   *Why?* Provides state-of-the-art models for both video generation from text and images, and high-quality, natural-sounding text-to-speech, forming the creative core of the application.

-   **📽️ Video Processing:** [FFmpeg.wasm](https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/)
    -   *Why?* This is the key to our client-side-first philosophy. Compiling the legendary FFmpeg C library to WebAssembly allows us to perform complex video manipulation directly in the browser, ensuring user privacy and eliminating the need for expensive, dedicated server infrastructure.

-   **🎨 Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    -   *Why?* A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid, consistent, and responsive UI development without leaving the HTML. It's highly customizable and helps keep the component files self-contained.

-   **📦 Module Loading:** ES Modules with Import Maps
    -   *Why?* A modern, browser-native approach to managing JavaScript modules. It avoids the need for a complex build step (like Webpack or Vite) for this project and allows us to load libraries like React and `@google/genai` directly from a CDN.
